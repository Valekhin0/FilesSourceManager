## About
  The library allows you to guarantee the existence of files used by your program on the disk. It also provides more convenient storage of paths to these files in the program.
## Install
```sh
npm install files-source-manager
```
## Usage
First, you need to create a configuration object.
It must include the `directory` string containing the path to the location where your
resource files will be located and the
`content` object, which is the contents of the folder specified in the `directory`.
Folders are defined by the names of objects, and files are defined by the values of string variables.
```ts

```
